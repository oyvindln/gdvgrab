A very bare-bones gtk+ GUI front-end for [dvgrab](https://github.com/ddennedy/dvgrab), using `ffplay`
from ffmpeg for the live preview.

Needs `dvgrab` and `ffmpeg` to be installed and available in `$PATH`.

Not very flexible yet, but the plan is to add support for all options in dvgrab.

Currently licensed under GPLv2 or later (as that's the license of dvgrab), but this may change
in the future.
